[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the [most popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) development environment. Following my work on [Mixer](/work/mixer), I realized that what I enjoyed my time most when I was building tools for developers. Also, after being on a 100-odd person engineering team, I realized I wanted to return to a smaller, more nimble team.

VS Code was at the apex of these two qualifications, but initially I didn't reach out since I assume it would be nearly-impossible to get in. (You don't maintain such a small team for such a wildly successful product by accident.) At the urging of my manager however, I did, and I ended up moving to the VS Code team in October of 2019.

Currently, my focus areas are:

- the [JavaScript debugger](/oss/js-debug) and profiling,
- [notebook renderers](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#output-renderer),
- ongoing work [on testing](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107467).
